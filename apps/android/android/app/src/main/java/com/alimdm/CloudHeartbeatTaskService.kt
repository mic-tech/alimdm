/**
 * Runs one cloud heartbeat while AliMDM is backgrounded.
 *
 * Why this exists: the heartbeat loop is a JS `setInterval`, and React Native stops
 * driving JS timers as soon as the activity pauses. JavaTimerManager.onHostPause()
 * clears the Choreographer callback that dispatches them, so behind a launched external
 * app the heartbeat simply stops, the cloud sees nothing for two minutes and reports the
 * device offline while it is running perfectly.
 *
 * A foreground service does not help: the process is alive and at normal priority, the
 * timers are just not being dispatched. The supported way back in is exactly this, a
 * headless task: JavaTimerManager.onHeadlessJsTaskStart() re-arms the same callback for
 * as long as the task runs, so the JS heartbeat executes normally and finishes.
 *
 * KioskWatchdogService starts one of these on its own ticker while the app is in the
 * background. In the foreground the JS interval works on its own and this never runs.
