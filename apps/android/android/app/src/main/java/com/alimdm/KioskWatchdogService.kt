/**
 * KioskWatchdogService — a START_STICKY foreground service that monitors AliMDM's
 * main process and relaunches it if it was killed (e.g. by the OOM killer).
 *
 * Fixes #96: On low-RAM devices (e.g. 2 GB AndroidTV), the browser can consume
 * enough memory for the kernel to kill AliMDM. Without a watchdog, the kiosk
 * simply disappears and the user lands on the launcher.
 *
 * The service:
 *  • Runs as a lightweight foreground service (START_STICKY) so Android restarts it
 *    if the process is killed.
 *  • Periodically checks whether MainActivity is in the recent-task list.
 *  • If MainActivity has vanished and kiosk mode is enabled, relaunches it.
 *
 * The service is started from BootReceiver and from MainActivity.onCreate().
 * It stops itself if kiosk mode is disabled.
